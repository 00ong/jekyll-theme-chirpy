Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ We just finished merging our main site aesthetic into the blog.

- **Fonts:** The entire experience now runs on `Orbitron` for headings and `Fira Code` for body copy, giving everything a crisp, mono-inspired feel.
- **Palette:** Buttons, cards, and callouts draw from the blue â†’ magenta â†’ amber â†’ green gradient you might recognize from the landing page.
- **Code:** Blocks inherit our terminal-lite styling, so snippets look exactly like the rest of the product docs.

> The mission was to make the blog feel indistinguishable from the app. Mission accomplished.

If you're curious about the details, pop open `assets/css/jekyll-theme-chirpy.scss`â€”the overrides use CSS custom properties so future tweaks stay minimal.

Happy publishing!
